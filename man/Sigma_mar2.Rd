\title{Compute the covariance matrix corresponding to a mixture of two
autoregressive (MAR) processes of order 1}
\usage{
Sigma_mar2(theta, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{a vector containing the MAR parameters returned by
\code{estim_mar2_link}}

\item{y}{a vector containing the observation time series associated with
\code{theta}}
}
\value{
a symmetric matrix corresponding to the MAR model.
}
\description{
\code{Sigma_mar2} takes the parameters returned by \code{estim_mar2_link}
(coefficient at lag 1 and variance) to calculate the matrix coefficients
whose formulation is given in equations 2 and 3 in Supplementary Material of
Qasmi and Ribes (2021).
